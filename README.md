Hilbish is a Unix-y shell which uses Lua for scripting. Things like the prompt,
general configuration and such are done with Lua.

For interactive use, it uses a library to run sh which works on all
platforms Hilbish can be compiled for. It can also act as a Lua REPL if you want
it to be.

## Nixpkgs
Nix/NixOS users can install Hilbish from the central repository, nixpkgs, through the usual ways.
If you're new to nix you should probably read up on how to do that [here](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Cheatsheet).

## Manual Build
### Prerequisites
- [Go 1.17+](https://go.dev)

#### Build
First, clone Hilbish. The recursive is required, as some Lua libraries
are submodules.  
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish
cd Hilbish
go get -d ./...
```  

To build, run:
```
make dev
```  

Or, if you want a stable branch, run these commands:
```
git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)
make build
```  

After you did all that, run `sudo make install` to install Hilbish globally.
